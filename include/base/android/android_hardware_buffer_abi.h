// Minimal binary interface definitions for AHardwareBuffer based on
// include/android/hardware_buffer.h from the Android NDK for platform level
// 26+. This is only intended for use from the AndroidHardwareBufferCompat
// wrapper for building without NDK platform level support, it is not a
// general-use header and is not complete.
//
// TODO(crbug.com/771171): Delete this file when third_party/android_tools/ndk/
// is updated to a version that contains the android/hardware_buffer.h file.
//
// Please refer to the API documentation for details:
// https://developer.android.com/ndk/reference/hardware__buffer_8h.html

#include <stdint.h>

// Use "C" linkage to match the original header file. This isn't strictly
// required since the file is not declaring global functions, but the types
// should remain in the global namespace for compatibility, and it's a reminder
// that forward declarations elsewhere should use "extern "C" to avoid
// namespace issues.
